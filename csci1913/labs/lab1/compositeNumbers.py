# CSCI 1913 Lab 01 Fall 2022
# All assignments should start with a "header comment" like this one.
# it should list what the file is (lab01 fall 2022) and who wrote it (below)
# This will be a standing REQUIREMENT for the whole semester.
# Authors: TODO: FILL YOUR NAME IN
#          TODO: FILL YOUR PARTNERS NAME IN


# NOTE: You should pay attention to how this file is structured -- you'll be making these files on your own after this
# lab -- so you'll want to know about all the "details" (other than correct code) that we expect! The big things to pay
# attention to here is the header comment at the top, and the docstrings (STRINGS on the first line of a function
# describing what the function does) -- this is a formal part of the programming language that is used to document code.

# but, for the actual submission -- this has to be deleted
