Q1:Owen Swearingen, I worked alone
Q2: all images are named the same as their csv files
Q3, insertion sort:
    a: The runtime rose and fell when it was random. when it was backwards it took as long as possible and made a perfect curve. otherwise it was mostly flat.
    b: the sort time was very inconsistent as it relys on the data being partially sorted beforehand
    c: goes from O(n) to O(n^2) very inconsistent with time
Q3, selection sort:
    a: consistently O(n^2) no matter the circumstances very flat line
    b: The sort time was consistent because its way of searching is to find the smallest and put it in the correct spot
    c: O(n^2) it was very consistent with its runtime
Q3, merge sort:
    a: the runtime was very linear and consistent along all lists
    b:the sort time was consistent
    c:O(N log(n)) the line was low and consistently so 
Q4: quick sort is faster but only sometimes merge sort is more consistent obviously there could be faster sorts based on how the data is layed out
Q5:merge sort is consistently fast so it would be the best in most cases.
