PROBLEM 1: Two-Pass Input and malloc()
======================================

  One frequently encounters the following situation when reading files
  - The file contains some data that is to be read into a dynamically
    allocated array
  - There is no indication of how much data is in the file

  C programs commonly use a *two-pass* input strategy to handle this
  situation
  1. Read through the file once to count items in the file, the allocate
     memory for an array of that size
  2. Back up to the beginning of the file and read data from the file
     into the array

  The provided program `twopass.c' demonstrates this technique along
  with several other input / formatting techniques.


A
~

  Compile and run the `twopass.c' program on the two provided text files
  `nums1.txt' and `nums2.txt'.  Paste the output the program produces
  below.


B
~

  Examine the function `read_all_doubles()' in `twopass.c' and describe
  which lines/blocks of code carry out the following actions. Use the
  provided comments in the file as a guide.

  - Opens the file for reading and checks for errors
  - Counts all the doubles in the file
  - Allocates memory for doubles in the file
  - Moves the file read position to the beginning of the file
  - Closes the file when reading is complete


C
~

  In your answer to the previous problem, you should have identified a
  use of `malloc()' in `read_all_doubles()'.  Where is this memory
  `free()''d and why? /Note: This question is similar to a lecture
  exercise on when to free() memory that has been malloc()'d./


D
~

  Examine how the doubles read from file are printed in the `main()'
  function. Discuss below the format specifiers used by `printf()' and
  the width/precision modifiers that are used to get a "table-like"
  appearance.  You may wish to consult the Manual page on `printf()'
  such as the one here:

  <https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/printf.3.html>


Optional Enrichment: Reading without Storing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  One minor irritation in `read_all_doubles()' is the following code:
  ,----
  |   double tmp;                              // temporary space to read one double
  |   ...;
  |   while(1){                                // first input pass: indefinite loop to count doubles
  |     int ret = fscanf(fin, "%lf", &tmp);    // try to read a double
  |     ...;
  |   }
  `----
  This loop is counting the doubles in an input file but discarding
  them.  Avoiding the need to allocate the `tmp' variable is desirable
  and can be done using some more advanced format specifiers in
  `fscanf() / scanf()' that indicate "read a double but do not store it
  anywhere". This allows the counting loop to happen without need for
  any additional space for doubles.

  Look how to get `fscanf()' to parse items like doubles without
  requiring space to store the result.


PROBLEM 2: Number conversions
=============================

A
~

  Fill in the following table of equivalences.  Filling in the table
  from top to bottom is advantageous as earlier rows can sometimes be
  used to infer lower values. Feel free to make use of any ASCII table
  or the table.c program provided in the week 3 lecture code pack.

PROBLEM 3: Signed Integer Conversions
=====================================

A
~

  Apply the steps involved in converting the following positive binary
  number to it's two's complement negation in 8-bit signed
  format. Recall the steps are
  - Invert the bits
  - Add one
  Apply these steps to the following number:
  ,----
  | 0111 1100  = 0x7C = 124 (decimal)
  `----

  The result is the two's complement representation of -124.

  Convert back to positive via the same process
  - Invert the bits
  - Add one
  to show that the original bits are gotten back.


B
~

  Complete the following table of equivalences assuming 8-bit
  twos-complement signed integers. The rightmost column is the inverse
  of the binary representation: flip 1's to 0's, and vice versa.

  ,----
  | |------+------+-----------+-----------|
  | |  Dec |  Hex | Binary    | Inverse   |
  | |------+------+-----------+-----------|
  | |   +5 | 0x05 | 0000 0101 | 1111 1010 |
  | |   -5 |    ? | 1111 1011 | ?         |
  | |  +32 | 0x20 | ?         | ?         |
