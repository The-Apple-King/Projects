Answer the questions below according to the project specification. Write
your answers directly in this text file and submit it along with your
code.


PROBLEM 1: sumdiag_OPTM()
=========================

  Do your timing study on loginNN.cselabs.umn.edu


(A) Paste Source Code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  int sumdiag_VER1(matrix_t *mat, vector_t *vec) {
  if(vec->len != (mat->rows + mat->cols -1)){
    printf("sumdiag_base: bad sizes\n");
    return 1;
  }

  vector_t vec1 = *vec;
  matrix_t mat1 = *mat;
  
  // create an array so we can increment the vals of diagonals instead of setting them repeatedly
  int* vecArr;
  vecArr = (int*) malloc(sizeof(int) * vec1.len+1);
  for(int i=0; i<vec1.len; i++){
   vecArr[i] = 0;
  }

  
  //acess rows then cols: makes full use of cache
  // loc is the diagonal location: created in loop so it doesnt take up space in register
  for (size_t y = 0, loc = 5; y < mat1.cols; y++, loc--){
    for (size_t x = 0; x < mat1.rows; x++){
      vecArr[loc + x] += MGET(mat1, x, y);
    }
  }
  
  // sets the val of vectors 1 by 1
  for (size_t i = 0; i < vec1.len; i++){
    VSET(vec1, i, vecArr[i]);
  }
    *vec = vec1;
}

(B) Timing on loginNN.cselabs.umn.edu
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Paste a copy of the results of running `sumdiag_benchmark' on
  loginNN.cselabs.umn.edu (like login01, login02, ..., login06) in the
  space below which shows how your performance optimizations improved on
  the baseline codes.

(C) Optimizations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Describe in some detail the optimizations you used to speed the code
  up.  THE CODE SHOULD CONTAIN SOME COMMENTS already to describe these
  but in the section below, describe in English the techniques you used
  to make the code run faster.  Format your descriptions into discrete
  chunks such as.
        Optimization 1: I created matrix_t and vector_t variables locally.
          This limits main memory access when accessing data.

        Optimization 2: replaced short function calls with macros.
          This is faster because instead of moving the pointer and accessing main memory 
          in order to access functions we avoid accessing main memory as much as possible.

        Optimization 3: changed how the matrix is accessed so that values are always sequential.
          this keeps the memory we access in the cache as much as possible

        Optimization 4: used an array to store vector vals and increment the value of each row sequentially.
          This is faster because it allows me to make use of the cache and 
          then only access the vector pointers one time limiting main memory access.

        ...  Optimization N: Blah bla blah... This should make run
        faster because yakkety yakeety yak.
  Full credit solutions will have a least THREE optimizations and
  describe WHY these improved performance in at least a couple
  sentences.

PROBLEM 2: Timing Search Algorithms
===================================

  Do your timing study on loginNN.cselabs.umn.edu. In most cases, report
  times larger than 1e-03 seconds as times shorter than this are
  unreliable. Run searches for more repetitions to lengthen run times.


(A) Min Size for Algorithmic Differences
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Determine the size of input array where one starts to see a measurable
  difference in the performance of the linear and logarithmic
  algorithms.  Produce a timing table which includes all algorithms
  which clearly demonstrates an uptick in the times associated with some
  while others remain much lower.  Identify what size this appears to be
  a occur.

  SHOW A TIMING TABLE to support your conclusions and ensure that the
  times reported are larger that 1e-03.

(B) Linear Search in List vs Array
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Determine whether the linear array and linked list search remain
  approximately at the same performance level as size increases to large
  data or whether one begins to become favorable over other. Determine
  the approximate size at which this divergence becomes obvious. Discuss
  reasons WHY this difference arises.

  SHOW A TIMING TABLE to support your conclusions and ensure that the
  times reported are larger that 1e-03.

(C) Binary Search in Tree vs Array
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Compare the binary array search and binary tree search on small to
  very large arrays. Determine if there is a size at which the
  performance of these two begins to diverge. If so, describe why this
  might be happening based on your understanding of the data structures
  and the memory system. If not, describe why you believe there is
  little performance difference between the two.

  SHOW A TIMING TABLE to support your conclusions and ensure that the
  times reported are larger that 1e-03.

(D) Caching Effects on Algorithms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  It is commonly believed that memory systems that feature a Cache will
  lead to arrays performing faster than linked structures such as Linked
  Lists and Binary Search Trees. Describe whether your timings confirm
  or refute this belief.  Address both types of algorithms in your
  answer:
  - What effects does Cache have on Linear Search in arrays and lists
    and why?
  - What effects does Cache have on Binary Search in arrays and trees
    and why?
