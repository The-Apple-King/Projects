# Problem 1

## given
``` Ocaml
    let rec prod (lst: int list) : int = match lst with  
    | [] -> 1  
    | y::ys -> y * prod ys
```

## prove: prod (l1 @ l2) = prod l1 * prod l2

## base case: base case l1 = []
    - prod [] @ l2 = prod l2 
        -by properties of list and append 

    - prod l2 = 1 * prodl2 
        -by identity property

    - prod [] * prod l2 = prod l2  
        -by definition of prod

## inductive case l1 = x::xs
    - prod (x::xs)@l2 = prod x @ xs @ l2  
        -by properties of lists  

    - x* prod xs@l2  
        -by definition of prod  

    - x* prod xs * prod l2

# Problem 2
## given
``` Ocaml
    let rec foldr (f: 'a -> 'b -> 'b) (lst: 'a list) (base: 'b) : 'b =  
    match lst with  
    | [] -> base  
    | x::xs -> f x (foldr f xs base)  

    let prod_fold (lst: int list) : int = foldr ( * ) lst 1  

    let rec prod (lst: int list) : int = match lst with  
    | [] -> 1  
    | y::ys -> y * prod ys  
```

## prove: prod lst = prod_fold lst
## base case: lst = []
       
    - prod [] = prod_fold []
    - prod [] = 1  
        -by properties of prod
    - prod_fold [] = foldr ( * ) [] 1 
        -by definition of prod_fold
    - foldr ( * ) [] 1 = 1
        -by definition of foldr
    - prod [] = prod_fold []
    - 1 = 1

## inductive case: lst = x::xs
    - prod [x::xs] = x * prod [xs] 
        -by inductive hypothesis  
   
    - prod_fold [x::xs] = foldr ( * ) [x::xs] 1  
        -by properties of prod_fold  

    - foldr ( * ) [x::xs] 1 = x * foldr ( * ) xs 1  
        -by inductive hypothesis  

    - x * prod [xs] = x * foldr ( * ) xs 1
      or x*prod xs = x * prod_fold xs  
        -by definitions of prod and prod_fold

# Problem 3
## given
``` Ocaml
    type nat = Zero | Succ of nat  
    
    let rec maximum (lst: nat list) : nat = match lst with  
    | [] -> Zero  
    | n::ns -> maxnat n (maximum ns)  

    maxnat Zero n = n  

    maxnat a (maxnat b c) = maxnat (maxnat a b) c  
```

## prove: maximum (l1 @ l2) = maxnat (maximum l1) (maximum l2)
 ## base case: l1 = []
    - maximum [] @ l2 = maximum l2
        -by properties of list and append
    - show maximum []@l2 = maximum zero::l2
        -by identity
    - maximum zero::l2 = maxnat zero maximum l2
        -by definition of maximum

 ## inductive case: l1 = [x]
    - maximum [x]@l2 = maximum x @ l2
        -by properties of lists 
    - maximum [x]@l2 = maxnat x (maximum (l2))
        -by definition of maximum
    - maxnat ([x]) (maximum l2)

# Problem 4
## part 1
``` Ocaml
    type 'a tree   
      = Leaf  
      | Fork of 'a tree * 'a * 'a tree  
```
      the principle of induction for this type is: for all t : 'a tree, P(t) holds if  
      P(Leaf), and  
    P(t1), and P(t2) implies P(Node(t1, v, t2) (for any value v of type 'a).  

## part 2
``` Ocaml
    type 'a rose_tree = Rose of 'a * 'a rose_tree list  
```
    the principle of induction for this type is: for all Rose: rose_tree, P(t) holds if  
    P(rose) implies P(Rose(v, rose_tree list)) for any value v of type 'a  

## part 3
``` Ocaml
    type 'a elf_tree = Empty  
    | Leaf of 'a  
    | Fork of 'a * 'a elf_tree * 'a elf_tree  
```
    the principle of induction for this type is: for all t : 'a tree, P(t) holds if  
    P(Leaf), and  
    P(t1), and P(t2) implies P(Node(v, t1, t2) (for any value v of type 'a).

# Problem 5
## given
``` Ocaml
    let rec height_rec (t: 'a elf_tree) : int = match t with
    | Empty -> 0
    | Leaf _ -> 1
    | Fork (_, l, r) -> 1 + max (height_rec l) (height_rec r)

    let rec reduce t (func) (x) = 
    match t with 
    | Empty -> x
    | Leaf p -> func p (reduce Empty (func) x) (reduce Empty (func) x)
    | Fork (n,l,r) -> func n (reduce l func x) (reduce r func x)


    let height t = reduce t ( fun _ l r -> 1 + max l r) 0 
```

## prove: height t = height rect t


## base case: t = leaf v
    - height_rec (leaf v) = 1
        -by definition of height_rec

    - height (leaf v) = height_rec (leaf v) 
        -as proven when height was tested

## inductive case: t = Fork(v, leaf1, leaf2)

    - height_rec Fork(v, leaf1, leaf2) = 1 + max height_rec leaf1 height rec leaf2
    - height_rec leaf = 1 
        -as shown in base case

    - 1+max height_rec leaf1 height rec leaf2 = 1+ max 1 1
        -by properties of height_rec

    - 1+ max 1 1 = 1 + 1 = 2
        -by properties of max

    - height Fork(v, leaf1, leaf2) = height_rec Fork(v, leaf1, leaf2)
        -as shown when height was originally tested
