== Test 2: fork_wait
== Runs the 'fork_wait' executable and passes it through the 'test_order_pids'
== script to ensure that the PIDs have a consistent ordering. Checks that the
== 'wait()'/'waitpid()' system call has been used to correctly cause parent
== processes to wait for children which will lead to a well-defined, ordered
== output shown below.
