    That said, the errors in the HTML provided can be fixed and the fix can be done without changing the intent of the code For youtube, 
    this will involve removing the invalid attribute (frameborder) and finding a suitable CSS replacement to keep the border hidden. 
    Doing this (fixing the embedded html to be error free without changing the meaning of the content) will be worth extra credit bonus points.
