vulnerability is a safety vulnerability

describing ideas will give partial credit
fully explaining one will give full credit

The idea is to audit the code, write a report on it then create an attack.

mentioned unexpected or broken bcbasic code to work
there are exploits that work outside gdb

written
report including 2–4 pages
one-inch margins
times new roman
10 points high
double spaced
should include a figure
labeled with your name and UMN email address, as well as the
names and addresses of the other members of your group.


As a final appendix to your report (a separate last page), write between one sentence
and one page describing the software and/or AI tools that assisted you in any of the phases
of the project. If you chose not to use any special tools, this could be a single sentence like
“The only tools I used were GDB and the spellchecker in Google Docs.” But we would like
to hear more details if you found other tools to be useful. We won’t reduce the credit you
get for the body of the report if you say, to take an extreme example, that you were able
to get a large language model to do the whole project for you by using the right prompts.
But we are interested in these information to inform how we adjust the project for future
versions of the course.
