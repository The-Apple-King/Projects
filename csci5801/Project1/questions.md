# from assumptions
webserver accessed through a website most likely
uses sql to store, sort and filter data on backend
required formatting controlled by admins

need to know, what data to store,
this will help us to decide how to store, and what to put on a gui.

how to access data, how are we searching or filtering or displaying data?


# actual requirements
* run loafr on a logfile to format it correctly
* both commandline and gui, gui in order to graph
* batch processing: after logs collected, once a day run analysis on files 
* take input, logfile, run analysis output is another logfile, same format
* ability to combine logfile input and output
* text data only
* windows/unix systems, preferable all of them. (web browser acceptable but with cmd probably not)

we will have out own sample data to build off of
