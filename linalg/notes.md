in order to do math on vectors/arrays they need to be the same size

dot product is "v1*w1 + v2*w2" 

if dot product is zero the lines are perpendicular

unit vector = 1 constructed when v =v1,v2
v' v1/length, v2/length

sqrt(v'^2) this should be 1 called normalization

||v-w|| we need to foil

need to use unit vectors to find angles otherwise we work on magnitude

<h2> unit vectors for angles </h2>

<h1>cosine formula</h1>

v dot w = cos (theta)


v/||v|| * w/||w|| = cos theta


schwarz inequality
||v*w|| <= ||v||*||w||
